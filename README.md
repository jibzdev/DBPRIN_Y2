# Database Principles Year 2 Coursework

Year 2 Software Engineering Coursework for database principles modile.

# Task
You are part of a team of junior database developers working for Performance Systems PLC and have been in post approximately 9 months. During this time you have been working on different existing database systems that have been developed by the company’s Senior DBA (You can assume that Val or Mark would have this role).

One  of the Company’s clients has asked for a system to be developed for them. The Senior DBA does not have the time to devote to this project and so has asked you to work out the design, development, implementation and justification for him. He will then check it over before it is delivered to the clients. 

Therefore, the work you produce is for a Senior DBA and as such you can assume they understand more about databases than you do however, make sure that you are clarifying odd or unclear aspects of your design through assumptions. Your report should take this into account and you should not spend time describing or explaining topics that the senior DBA already knows (e.g. why you have an PK in a table) but you should analyse their importance and relevance in the given case study. This coursework follows the lifecycle of database implementation.  The first stage is to try and identify the data and the organisational / linkage of the data for the system.
